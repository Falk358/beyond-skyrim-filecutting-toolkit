# Filecutter Toolkit

The original Version of this Toolkit was created for the Skywind Project. This version was modified as of 27.12.2024.
This project contains a collection of tools modified to help the filecutting process for the Beyond Skyrim project: This version of the toolkit supports excel files exported by the `Skyrim Creation Kit`.

See the original Skywind Filecutter Toolkit [Wiki](https://gitlab.com/Slaynot/filecutter-toolkit/-/wikis/home) for more information on how to setup and use this project.

For Linux Users, you can follow the instructions from the Wiki but substitute `install.bat` with `install.sh`. Note that in most Linux distributions, you will need to make `install.sh` executable by opening the Beyond Skyrim filecutting toolkit directory in the terminal and running `chmod +x install.sh`.
